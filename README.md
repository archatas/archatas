### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Aidas, a Lithuanian living in Berlin, Germany. I've been working in the Web Development field for 20 years.

I am currently developing [PyBazaar - Python Developer Marketplace](https://www.pybazaar.com/).

These are some of my achievements:

- I have developed, provided, and supported the prioritization service [1st things 1st](https://www.1st-things-1st.com).
- I built the [Django GDPR Cookie Consent app](https://websightful.gumroad.com/l/django-gdpr-cookie-consent) for Django websites that use cookies.
- I curate the [DjangoTricks](https://www.djangotricks.com/) website and related blog and Twitter profile about website development with the Django framework.
